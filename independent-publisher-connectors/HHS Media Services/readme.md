# HHS Media Services
The Department of Health and Human Service have created an easy way for public health partners to access federally produced digital resources - including web content, images, video, data, infographics, and more - for use on websites, apps, and social media. Syndication allows science-based resources to be combined with information at state and local levels by sharing health messaging for maximum impact.
